**Date:** 2025-10-13
**Project:** startup-sniff
**Analyst:** Benjamin

## Assessment Results

### Project Classification

- **Project Type:** Web application
- **Project Level:** Level 3 (Full Product)
- **Instruction Set:** instructions-lg.md (Large/Complex Projects)

### Scope Summary

- **Brief Description:** Transform StartupSniff from passive validation platform into active momentum engine with three distinct pillars: (1) Magical Reddit extraction with cross-subreddit AI analysis, (2) Guided human contact workflow with message templates and conversation tracking, (3) Network intelligence foundation building defensive data moat through collective learning
- **Estimated Stories:** 30-40 stories across three major epics
- **Estimated Epics:** 3 primary epics (Pillar 1: Reddit Extraction Engine, Pillar 2: Human Contact Workflow, Pillar 3: Network Intelligence Foundation)
- **Timeline:** 14-20 weeks (3.5-5 months) for complete MVP with phased validation gates

### Context

- **Greenfield/Brownfield:** Brownfield - Adding to existing StartupSniff codebase with active development (Vercel analytics integration, usage reconciliation features recently merged)
- **Existing Documentation:**
  - ✅ Comprehensive Product Brief (1,510 lines, highly detailed)
  - ✅ Brainstorming Session Results (2025-10-13, four-technique analysis)
  - ✅ Active codebase with technical infrastructure (Next.js, Supabase, Vercel)
  - ✅ Git repository with recent feature development and PRs
- **Team Size:** Solo founder (Benjamin) with optional contractor support for specific features (UI polish, design)
- **Deployment Intent:** Production SaaS with phased rollout strategy:
  - Month 1-2: Pillar 1 validation (free tier, measure engagement)
  - Month 3-4: Pillar 2 launch + monetization ($20/month paid tier)
  - Month 5-6: Pillar 3 foundation (network intelligence MVP)

## Recommended Workflow Path

### Primary Outputs

**Required Documentation:**

1. **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** - Full Level 3 specification including:
   - Executive summary and business objectives
   - Detailed user personas (Anxious First-Timer, Serial Experimenter)
   - User stories with acceptance criteria for all 30-40 stories
   - Phased feature roadmap aligned with validation gates
   - Success metrics and analytics requirements
   - Risk mitigation strategies

2. **Epic Breakdown Document** - Three major epics with story mapping:
   - Epic 1: Pillar 1 - Magical Reddit Extraction Engine
   - Epic 2: Pillar 2 - Guided Human Contact Workflow
   - Epic 3: Pillar 3 - Network Intelligence Foundation

3. **Technical Specification** - Architecture and implementation details (via 3-solutioning workflow):
   - System architecture design
   - Database schema and data model
   - API integration specifications (Reddit, OpenAI)
   - Authentication/authorization flows (Reddit OAuth)
   - Caching and performance optimization strategy
   - Scaling considerations and cost controls

4. **UX Specification** (Optional, may be deferred) - User experience and interface design:
   - User flow diagrams for each pillar
   - Wireframes for critical paths
   - Design system guidelines

### Workflow Sequence

**Step 1: Complete PRD Development** (Current Step)
- Execute PRD workflow using instructions-lg.md
- Capture all requirements from product brief
- Define user stories with clear acceptance criteria
- Establish success metrics and validation gates
- Document phased rollout strategy

**Step 2: Architecture & Technical Design** (After PRD)
- Invoke 3-solutioning workflow for Level 3 projects
- System architecture design review
- Database schema design and optimization
- API integration strategy (Reddit API rate limits, OpenAI cost controls)
- Performance and scaling considerations
- Security and compliance requirements (OAuth, GDPR, data privacy)

**Step 3: Epic Planning & Story Mapping** (Parallel with Tech Spec)
- Break down three pillars into detailed user stories
- Prioritize stories within each epic
- Estimate effort and dependencies
- Create sprint/iteration plan

**Step 4: Implementation Readiness** (Handoff)
- Final review of all documentation
- Development team onboarding
- Sprint 0 preparation (tooling, environments, CI/CD)

### Next Actions

**Immediate (Today):**
1. ✅ Execute PRD workflow for Level 3 project
2. Capture detailed requirements for all three pillars
3. Define user stories with acceptance criteria
4. Document success metrics and validation gates

**Short-term (This Week):**
1. Complete PRD first draft
2. Review and refine with stakeholder feedback
3. Initiate 3-solutioning workflow for technical architecture
4. Begin epic breakdown and story mapping

**Medium-term (Next 2 Weeks):**
1. Finalize all planning documentation
2. Technical architecture review and approval
3. Sprint planning for Pillar 1 (Month 1 features)
4. Development kickoff

## Special Considerations

### Critical Success Factors

**Phased Validation with Kill Criteria:**
- Month 1 GREEN zone required before Pillar 2 development: >2min session time, >25% 7-day return rate
- Month 2 human contact appetite validation: >10% click-through to Reddit profiles
- Month 3 monetization validation: >5% free-to-paid conversion, >10% message send rate
- Each phase has explicit RED zone criteria for pivot/kill decisions

**Guided Discovery Philosophy:**
- "Meet users where they are (seeking ideas), guide them where they should go (talking to humans)"
- Avoid forced compliance workflows that violate user autonomy
- Earn the right to suggest human contact by proving Pillar 1 value first

**Platform Risk Mitigation:**
- Reddit API ban risk requires user's own OAuth (distributed sending)
- Multi-platform roadmap (LinkedIn, Discord) as insurance against platform dependency
- Rate limiting (5 messages/day) to prevent spam perception

**Network Effects Cold Start:**
- Pillar 3 provides limited value until 1,000+ experiments collected
- Manual curation of early patterns to provide social proof before critical mass
- Focus on Pillar 1/2 value delivery while building data moat in background

### Financial Constraints

**Bootstrapped Development Model:**
- Cash budget: $800-$4,900 for MVP (14 weeks)
- Part-time development: 15-20 hours/week
- Revenue urgency: Need $200 MRR by Month 3 to validate market + cover API costs
- OpenAI API cost controls: Aggressive caching, batch processing (<$500/month)

### User Psychology Alignment

**Target: Anxious First-Time Founders**
- 70.5% lack critical skills (leadership, communication, strategy)
- 72.7% experience financial anxiety
- 72% struggle with mental health (37% anxiety, 36% burnout)
- Need "permission to act" through structured guidance, not forced compliance

**Transformation Goal:**
- Move from "anxious paralysis" to "productive momentum" in <30 minutes
- First customer conversation within 7 days (vs. industry 30+ days)
- Compress validation from 6-12 months to 60-90 days
